LEAGUE STANDING [EXAM 3] DUE October 20th in Blackboard


Create a program that keeps track of a sports league.  The program will have a struct that may have the following fields: Home Team, Away Team, Home Score, and Away Score.  Other structs may be used.  The league has a schedule.  You are to assume the league’s record keeper is using your program to record the results of each game.  You program will display the current standing for the league when requested.  When someone selects the “enter the result of a game” you will receive four values (see above).  SEE ASSUMPTIONS BELOW.
HERE IS A SAMPLE PROGRAM MENU

          1)	Enter the result of a game
          2)	Display the league standings 
          3)	Restart the entire season
          4)	Quit the program
